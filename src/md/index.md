### Change History

- 2019-07-08: Initial draft

## Name

United Cycling Team is an organization committed to cycling, specifically amateur road racing. The team has informally organized chapters in Austin, Texas and Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas. This document describes bylaws, rules, and procedures for only the Dallas/Fort Worth chapter.

## Scope

This is not a legal document. It is a written and informally-accepted set of rules and procedures for common scenarios. It is not an exhaustive description of all rules and contingencies. Formal changes to the rules should be added to the record in this document, but it is the prerogative of teammates to deviate from these rules if necessary.

## Membership

Membership in the team is invite-only.
