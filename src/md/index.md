### Change History

- 2019-07-08: Initial draft

## Team

United Cycling Team is an organization committed to cycling, specifically amateur road racing. The team has informally organized chapters in Austin, Texas and Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas. This document describes bylaws, rules, and procedures for only the Dallas/Fort Worth chapter.

## Scope

This is not a legal document. It is a written and informally-accepted set of rules and procedures for common scenarios. It is not an exhaustive description of all rules and contingencies. Formal changes to the rules should be added to the record in this document, but it is the prerogative of teammates to deviate from these rules if necessary.

## Team Values

United Cycling Team is dedicated to the enjoyment of racing and road cycling, specifically events like road races and criteriums. Other cycling disciplines are encouraged as "extracurricular" activities, but the team is synonymous with road racing. The team strives to maintain an overwhelmingly positive reputation in both the racing and non-racing cycling communities by being courteous, professional, and helpful whenever representing the team or its sponsors.

## Membership

### New members

Membership in the team is invite-only. Any current member of the team can sponsor another person for invitation, simply by suggesting to the rest of the team that they would like a particular person to join. The prospective team member must join the team on two or more rides at which a large portion of the team is present. The purpose of these rides is for the existing team members to get to know the new person and evaluate their capabilities, personality, and general match with the rest of the team. After having ridden with the prospective member, the existing team members should have an informal vote (show of hands, nays only, etc.) about whether the new person should finally join the team.

To recap, the process for adding new members goes something like this:

1. Meet somebody who embodies the team values and would be a valuable addition to the team
1. Suggest inviting the new member on the next team training rides to the rest of the team
1. After riding with the new member a few times, confirm with the rest of the team if they are OK extending an offer to join the team.
1. Ask the member to join. They're “official” once they're riding in team kit, which they might borrow from another teammate or buy themselves.

### Cutting members

Team members who are chronically not meeting race commitments or contributing to the team's goals may be asked to leave at the end of the road racing season. Generally, having an inactive team member is less of a liability than having that person as a competitor, and the bridges burned by cutting people are not easily restored, so cutting members for inactivity should be considered carefully.

In extreme circumstances, members may be asked to leave the team immediately if they egregiously engage in conduct that reflects poorly on the team or its sponsors, are abusive or harassing to other team members, or otherwise behave in behave in a way that is extremely inconsistent with the team's values.

## Racing Commitments

As this is a road racing team, members are expected to regularly participate in road racing events. Generally, each team member should participate in at least 5 road races or criteriums per year, excluding local weekly crits. In order to consolidate participation and ensure adequate team sizes at each race, team members should evaluate upcoming races and consider their importance for the team in general, as well as their importance for individual riders.

Starting at least 6 weeks prior to a targeted race, the following steps should be taken:

1. The entire team should be reminded that the given race is being targeted.
1. The team should organize themselves into squads for each applicable race field. 4-5 teammates per field is ideal.
1. As soon as registration opens for the race, all participating teammates should register.
1. Members of each squad are responsible for training together as necessary and determining strategy for the race.
